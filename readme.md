I figured to make my paper company unique, I would focus on the environmental aspect with the claim that it uses 100% recycled material. I looked at other paper websites for inspiration, and lots of them spoke about environmental impact. I decided on a green color motif to accentuate the green impact. The logo doesn't quite match, but I was running out of time.

The header can navigate within the page.

My about us part of the page is quite simple, just a paragraph and picture.

The environmental impact portion has a paragraph that ideally stresses how great they are. Then there's the interactive tree part where you can eliminate or grow trees depending on what button you press.

The products took me ages to get right. I was trying to get pictures to slide in and out but settled for just sliding in.

The testimonials have four quotes that fade in and out.

Footer has popups that say the handle and whatnot, but in a real website would navigate to external links.
